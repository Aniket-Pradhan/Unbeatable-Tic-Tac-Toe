# Unbeatable-Tic-Tac-Toe
Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe. Made using Python.
Initially this was given as a project in CSE101 course to implement a Tic Tac Toe game in Python without using arrays (lists).
So, I have added that project in Project branch.
Now, I have added GUI functionality to the code using Python and added it in the master branch.
